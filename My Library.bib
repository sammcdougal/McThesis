  abstract = {The next phase of satellite technology is being characterized by a new evolution in non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellites, which conveys exciting new communication capabilities to provide non-terrestrial connectivity solutions and to support a wide range of digital technologies from various industries. NGSO communication systems are known for a number of key features such as lower propagation delay, smaller size, and lower signal losses in comparison to the conventional geostationary orbit (GSO) satellites, which can potentially enable latency-critical applications to be provided through satellites. NGSO promises a substantial boost in communication speed and energy efficiency, and thus, tackling the main inhibiting factors of commercializing GSO satellites for broader utilization. The promised improvements of NGSO systems have motivated this paper to provide a comprehensive survey of the state-of-theart NGSO research focusing on the communication prospects, including physical layer and radio access technologies along with the networking aspects and the overall system features and architectures. Beyond this, there are still many NGSO deployment challenges to be addressed to ensure seamless integration not only with GSO systems but also with terrestrial networks. These unprecedented challenges are also discussed in this paper, including coexistence with GSO systems in terms of spectrum access and regulatory issues, satellite constellation and architecture designs, resource management problems, and user equipment requirements. Finally, we outline a set of innovative research directions and new opportunities for future NGSO research.},

  abstract = {Signal recording and replaying is widely used in data analysis, device test, etc. Motivated by this fact, our paper focuses on developing a low-cost record-and-replay prototype based on USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral). In particular, we designed and developed a GPS (Global Positioning System) record-and-replay system, which can sample the real GPS signal and then output the analog GPS signal to other devices with cable. In this prototype, we first design the record flow graph and the replay flow graph for USRP, which is verified in the FM band with the FM (Frequency Modulation) broadcasting. After that, we replace the passive antenna with one active antenna suit to amplify the small power GPS signal, lower the quantization bits to reduce the data rate in order to support the wide bandwidth of the GPS signal. Finally, our GPS record-and-replay system is tested and verified by a real GPS receiver. The good performance of our GPS record-and-replay system showed that USRPs can not only used in academia as experiment devices but also used in industry as low-cost wireless auxiliary devices.},

  abstract = {Recent increases in the computational power of computers and digital signal processors have made possible new, novel signal tracking techniques in GPS receivers. One such technique is known as Direct Correlator Output Processing (DCOP). This technique replaces individual traditional tracking loops with a single Kaiman Filter, which jointly processes the received signals while exploiting their correlated noises. DCOP is innovative in its potential to replace the tried and true classical signal tracking loops. It is also an enabling technology for ultra-tightly coupled GPS/INS (Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System). Potential benefits of these new tracking techniques include an order-of-magnitude improvement in positional accuracy in environments ofjamming and high dynamics. However, such performance gains are typically based on software simulations of conceptual GPS receiver designs, not working prototypes. Simulating these new designs requires the modeling of GPS signals and receiver tracking loops, instead of the traditional pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements, which many proven GPS simulation software packages accurately model. The purpose of this research has been to develop an accurate, user-friendly, and customizable GPS signal and receiver model to use for a fair and unbiased evaluation of advanced receiver designs. The result of this research is a Matlab® GPS signal simulator, a Simulink® GPS receiver model implementing true receiver DSP processing, and a Matlab" high-speed signal/receiver model that approximates the signal simulator and receiver model.},

  abstract = {A software-based intermediate frequency (IF) GPS signal simulator for the L1 C/A code signal is developed and verified in this thesis. The signal simulator is implemented in MATLAB with some key functions coded in C to accelerate speed of operation. A mathematical signal model is developed that expresses the digitized IF GPS signal as a function of various errors during propagation, such as satellite clock error, ionosphere error, and troposphere error; and user defined parameters, such as date and GPS time, user trajectory, expected C/N0, noise density, intermediate frequency, sampling rate, front-end bandwidth, and quantization bit. The simulator is verified by comparing the simulated signal with the hardware-collected IF GPS signal in the time, frequency, correlation and position domains. Partially for the simulator verification purpose, a software GPS receiver was developed and verified, which was used to process the simulated signal to get the pseudorange and carrier phase measurements. The signal acquisition and tracking techniques originally studied and verified in this thesis were used for the first generation software receiver developed by the PLAN group of the Department of Geomatics Engineering. The receiver consists of the following modules: signal acquisition, signal tracking, bit synchronization, sub-frame synchronization and the navigation solution. It is verified by using a set of real GPS signal measurements collected by a commercial hardware frontend and comparing the tracking results and navigation solution with the corresponding results of a hardware GPS receiver.},

  abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS) signals adopt spreading spectrum technology, which could effectively reduce the consumption of signal transmitting power. Nevertheless, the GPS signals may be blocked unexpectedly in complicated environments. In this case, the stronger signals transmitted from Low-Earth-Orbital (LEO) communication satellite systems could be considered to aid in GPS service provision. However, the dynamic of an LEO satellite is relatively high, which causes difficulties with its integration into the general GPS receiver design. Doppler positioning algorithms can benefit from this high dynamic characteristic. In this paper, considering Doppler shifts as measurements, a Doppler Positioning algorithm is introduced. Since no navigation message can be decoded from the signals, satellite orbit prediction using the two-line orbital element set (TLE) will be involved. One commercial LEO communication satellite system is selected as well as the configurable frontend Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) for the LEO signal collection and processing. A static experiment in an open field is conducted in this research. The experimental results for the open field test indicate that the positioning performance might not gain improvement from the use of an LEO signal because of orbit prediction errors or the quality of its measurement is not as good as that of GPS; but the important thing is that the LEO signal can extend positioning service in situations where the number of GPS satellites in-view are less than four due to signal obstructions. This paper presents the results of the enhanced navigation service provided by GPS with the aid of the LEO satellite.},

  abstract = {The Argos service was launched in 1978 to serve environmental applications, including oceanography, wildlife tracking, fishing vessel monitoring, and maritime safety. The system allows for worldwide near-real-time positioning and data collection of platform terminal transmitters (PTTs). The positioning of the PTTs is achieved by exploiting the Doppler shift in the carrier frequency of the transmitter as recorded by satelliteborne Argos receivers. Until March 15, 2011, a classical nonlinear least squares estimation technique was systematically used to estimate Argos positions. Since then, a second positioning algorithm using a multiple-model Kalman filter was implemented in the operational Argos positioning software. This paper presents this new algorithm and analyzes its performance using a large data set obtained from over 200 mobiles carrying both an Argos transmitter and a GPS receiver used as ground truth. The results show that the new algorithm significantly improves the positioning accuracy, particularly in difficult conditions (for class-A and class-B locations, in the Argos terminology). Moreover, the new algorithm enables the retrieval of a larger number of estimated positions and the systematic estimation of the location error.},

  author = {Powell, Russell},
  abstract = {This thesis details the design of a software GPS signal simulator and illustrates how it can be used to support rapid testing of GPS interference mitigation research. The MATLABbased signal simulator is capable of generating digital GPS signals at intermediate frequencies (IF) for multiple-element, controlled-radiation-pattern-antenna (CRPA) con gurations in jamming environments. The simulator was developed to support novel GPS interference mitigation research conducted in the GPS and Vehicle Dynamics Laboratory at Auburn University. The digital signals can be analyzed with software acquisition, tracking, and positioning techniques or can be converted to analog signals at the GPS radio frequencies and played to multiple receivers via cabling using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) software-de ned-radio (SDR) platform. An IF GPS signal for a single antenna generated by the software simulator was playedback and recorded simultaneously with USRPs and compared to an IF signal for the same scenario generated by a hardware GPS simulator that was also recorded with a USRP. Position, velocity, pseudorange, Doppler frequency, and carrier-to-noise ratio measurements calculated by a software receiver from the simulated IF signal, the played-back and recorded IF signal, and the signal generated by the hardware simulator are compared to evaluate the baseline performance of the software simulator. Results of this experiment illustrate that a software simulator paired with the USRP is comparable in performance to the hardware simulator. Additionally, a dynamic scenario generated by the software simulator was playedback and recorded with USRPs and also played to a hardware GPS receiver. Position results calculated by a software receiver from the simulated and played-back and recorded signals were compared to results calculated by the hardware receiver to further evaluate the performance of the software simulator. These results illustrate that the software simulator is capable of generating GPS signals for dynamic trajectories. To illustrate the capabilities provided by a software-based GPS simulator, signals along with three types of simulated jammers were generated and are illustrated in the frequency, time, and histogram domains . Each interference signal was played-back and recorded with USRPs, and results are provided to illustrate the steps that must be taken to capture the e ects of simulated jammers in a USRP playback or record. Additionally, a 4-element CRPA interference simulation was generated by the software simulator and analyzed with a software receiver that was modi ed to include several interference mitigation techniques. Results provided by the modi ed software receiver illustrate that a software GPS simulator is a powerful tool for developing GPS interference mitigation techniques. Lastly, the simulated CRPA signals were played-back and recorded simultaneously with multiple USRPs to examine the feasibility of using relatively inexpensive SDRs to simulate multiple-antenna GPS scenarios. Results from this test illustrate that a multiple-USRP setup is a useful tool for testing robust interference mitigation techniques.},

This system could provide an alternative to pseudorange-based GNSS. The concept uses a high-fidelity model of received carrier Doppler shift. This model is used in a point-solution batch filter that simultaneously estimates eight unknowns: the three position vector components, receiver clock offset, three velocity vector components, and receiver clock offset rate. The filter uses eight or more measured Doppler shifts in its least-squares fit. A generalized Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) analysis indicates that absolute position accuracies on the order of 1-5 meters and absolute velocity accuracies on the order of 0.01 m/sec to 0.05 m/sec may be achievable if the range-rate precision of the Doppler shift measurements is 0.01 m/sec. These accuracies are comparable to current pseudorange-based GNSS. Clock offset accuracy is on the order of 0.0001 to 0.0010 sec 1-𝜎.},

Coupled with smartphones, the blue dot in the palm of our hands has forever changed the way we interact with the world. Looking forward, cyber-physical systems such as self-driving cars and aerial mobility are pushing the limits of what localization technologies including GNSS can provide. This autonomous revolution requires a solution that supports safety-critical operation, centimeter positioning, and cyber-security for millions of users. To meet these demands, we propose a navigation service from Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites which deliver precision in-part through faster motion, higher power signals for added robustness to interference, constellation autonomous integrity monitoring for integrity, and encryption / authentication for resistance to spoofing attacks. This paradigm is enabled by the `New Space' movement, where highly capable satellites and components are now built on assembly lines and launch costs have decreased by more than tenfold. Such a ubiquitous positioning service enables a consistent and secure standard where trustworthy information can be validated and shared, extending the electronic horizon from sensor line of sight to an entire city.

  abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) system has a number of disadvantages such as weak signal strength and high cost, while signals of opportunity (SOPs) can make up for these shortcomings. Non-GNSS satellite SOPs offer some advantages in terms of high signal strength, low cost that belong to ground-based SOPs and better coverage than ground-based SOPs. We investigate a new method of instantaneous Doppler positioning with Iridium signals that are treated as satellite SOPs. Initially, the Iridium SOPs positioning system is introduced through a description of its characteristics and components. Next, the instantaneous Doppler positioning algorithm is introduced, and the effects of measurement errors and satellite orbital errors on the positioning solution are analyzed by a new method. Furthermore, the influence of constellation geometrical distribution on positioning performance is analyzed based on the relative position relationship between discrete distribution points of the receiver position. Finally, the simulation data are used for theoretical verification, and the real data experiment is implemented with IRIDIUM NEXT signals. The results show that two-dimensional (2-D) position accuracies of approximately 22 m (1σ) can be achieved with the height aiding when the static receiver has a complete view of the sky.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method for positioning using Low Earth Orbit (LEO) signals of opportunity. A stationary base-station and roving receiver framework is presented wherein the base-station performs Angle of Arrival (AOA) estimation of the LEO signals to obtain azimuth and elevation angles and shares them with a roving receiver. With the AOA estimates and differential Doppler positioning, there is no need for either the base station or roving receiver to have precise knowledge of the LEO satellite states. In this way, a constellation agnostic positioning approach that addresses one of the primary issues with navigation from signals of opportunity – the lack of knowledge of transmitter states – is developed. The accuracy requirements of the AOA estimates are investigated and the feasibility of this positioning method is discussed. The results of this analysis will show that with a single constellation, the range of noise on the AOA estimates that will produce acceptable position estimates is severely limited. As multiple constellations are used and the number of measurements increases, it becomes more resilient to distortion in the geometry matrix and noise on the Doppler measurements.},

  abstract = {Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have stronger received signals and more rapid geometry changes than Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites, making them attractive for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) applications. Due to the low altitude, the LEO constellation requires more satellites to cover the entire globe and more Pseudo Random Noise (PRN) codes to realize Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), which means greater receiver storage resources and receiver acquisition time. In this paper, different from the traditional methods that assign a unique PRN code to each satellite, we propose a novel method in which several satellites share the same PRN code, and simply demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of this method. To determine the minimum number of PRN codes needed for a constellation, we build a mathematical model. After the algorithm comparison, we improve the recursive largest first (RLF) algorithm so that it has a higher running speed and a smaller approximate optimal solution within a certain time period. By studying polar-orbiting and walker constellations, we find that if other satellite parameters remain the same, the higher the orbital altitude is, the more PRN codes are needed, and no matter what the orbital inclination is, the minimum number of PRN codes remains the same. Overall, it is feasible and meaningful for several satellites sharing the same PRN code to save storage resources and reduce the satellite acquisition time of the receiver. If this new technology is applied, the storage resources and the average satellite acquisition time of the receiver will be, at most, one-third of previous ones.},

  abstract = {With the recent rapid development of satellite technologies and satellite launching vehicle, constructing a LEO mega constellation (i.e. with hundreds or even thousands of satellites) to provide high-performance Internet access with global coverage becomes a reality. Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a type of self-configuring wireless network with high flexibility and high mobility. Thus, the combination of satellite networks (particularly LEO mega constellations) and MANETs will be able to provide a comprehensive Internet access service to anyone in anywhere at anytime. The focus of this thesis is to explore the potential of the proposed fully-integrated satellite and terrestrial networks and to meet the technical challenges with required performance, which has been rarely discussed before. The main contributions of this thesis include: Firstly, a novel Mobile Ad hoc Network routing protocol (AOMDV-SIR) optimised for internetworking with satellite networks is proposed. This protocol specifically takes satellite communication characteristics into account to make traditional terrestrial MANETs ready for the integration by dynamically balancing traffic among satellite gateways while providing competitive or even better performance than other MANET routing protocols. Secondly, a novel routing scheme (HAMS) for inter-satellite routing in Satellite Ad hoc Network (SANET) is proposed. It provides an autonomous routing solution for LEO mega constellations without ground stations’ involvement. According to simulations, it can offer better network performance especially in long-distance communication scenarios. Thirdly, a coherent routing scheme for the satellite and terrestrial integrated network is proposed. Unlike current satellite-terrestrial integration approaches, the proposed scheme is designed for a fully-integrated network (i.e. terrestrial network and satellite network share the same priority). Compare to currently available techniques, the proposed network structure and routing scheme can greatly expand communication network application area and can achieve better service quality.}
