  abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS) signals adopt spreading spectrum technology, which could effectively reduce the consumption of signal transmitting power. Nevertheless, the GPS signals may be blocked unexpectedly in complicated environments. In this case, the stronger signals transmitted from Low-Earth-Orbital (LEO) communication satellite systems could be considered to aid in GPS service provision. However, the dynamic of an LEO satellite is relatively high, which causes difficulties with its integration into the general GPS receiver design. Doppler positioning algorithms can benefit from this high dynamic characteristic. In this paper, considering Doppler shifts as measurements, a Doppler Positioning algorithm is introduced. Since no navigation message can be decoded from the signals, satellite orbit prediction using the two-line orbital element set (TLE) will be involved. One commercial LEO communication satellite system is selected as well as the configurable frontend Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) for the LEO signal collection and processing. A static experiment in an open field is conducted in this research. The experimental results for the open field test indicate that the positioning performance might not gain improvement from the use of an LEO signal because of orbit prediction errors or the quality of its measurement is not as good as that of GPS; but the important thing is that the LEO signal can extend positioning service in situations where the number of GPS satellites in-view are less than four due to signal obstructions. This paper presents the results of the enhanced navigation service provided by GPS with the aid of the LEO satellite.},

  abstract = {The Argos service was launched in 1978 to serve environmental applications, including oceanography, wildlife tracking, fishing vessel monitoring, and maritime safety. The system allows for worldwide near-real-time positioning and data collection of platform terminal transmitters (PTTs). The positioning of the PTTs is achieved by exploiting the Doppler shift in the carrier frequency of the transmitter as recorded by satelliteborne Argos receivers. Until March 15, 2011, a classical nonlinear least squares estimation technique was systematically used to estimate Argos positions. Since then, a second positioning algorithm using a multiple-model Kalman filter was implemented in the operational Argos positioning software. This paper presents this new algorithm and analyzes its performance using a large data set obtained from over 200 mobiles carrying both an Argos transmitter and a GPS receiver used as ground truth. The results show that the new algorithm significantly improves the positioning accuracy, particularly in difficult conditions (for class-A and class-B locations, in the Argos terminology). Moreover, the new algorithm enables the retrieval of a larger number of estimated positions and the systematic estimation of the location error.},

  title = {A {{Multiple-Antenna Software GPS Signal Simulator forRapid Testing}} of {{Interference Mitigation Techniques}}},
  author = {Powell, Russell},
  abstract = {This thesis details the design of a software GPS signal simulator and illustrates how it can be used to support rapid testing of GPS interference mitigation research. The MATLABbased signal simulator is capable of generating digital GPS signals at intermediate frequencies (IF) for multiple-element, controlled-radiation-pattern-antenna (CRPA) congurations in jamming environments. The simulator was developed to support novel GPS interference mitigation research conducted in the GPS and Vehicle Dynamics Laboratory at Auburn University. The digital signals can be analyzed with software acquisition, tracking, and positioning techniques or can be converted to analog signals at the GPS radio frequencies and played to multiple receivers via cabling using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) software-dened-radio (SDR) platform. An IF GPS signal for a single antenna generated by the software simulator was playedback and recorded simultaneously with USRPs and compared to an IF signal for the same scenario generated by a hardware GPS simulator that was also recorded with a USRP. Position, velocity, pseudorange, Doppler frequency, and carrier-to-noise ratio measurements calculated by a software receiver from the simulated IF signal, the played-back and recorded IF signal, and the signal generated by the hardware simulator are compared to evaluate the baseline performance of the software simulator. Results of this experiment illustrate that a software simulator paired with the USRP is comparable in performance to the hardware simulator. Additionally, a dynamic scenario generated by the software simulator was playedback and recorded with USRPs and also played to a hardware GPS receiver. Position results calculated by a software receiver from the simulated and played-back and recorded signals were compared to results calculated by the hardware receiver to further evaluate the performance of the software simulator. These results illustrate that the software simulator is capable of generating GPS signals for dynamic trajectories. To illustrate the capabilities provided by a software-based GPS simulator, signals along with three types of simulated jammers were generated and are illustrated in the frequency, time, and histogram domains . Each interference signal was played-back and recorded with USRPs, and results are provided to illustrate the steps that must be taken to capture the eects of simulated jammers in a USRP playback or record. Additionally, a 4-element CRPA interference simulation was generated by the software simulator and analyzed with a software receiver that was modied to include several interference mitigation techniques. Results provided by the modied software receiver illustrate that a software GPS simulator is a powerful tool for developing GPS interference mitigation techniques. Lastly, the simulated CRPA signals were played-back and recorded simultaneously with multiple USRPs to examine the feasibility of using relatively inexpensive SDRs to simulate multiple-antenna GPS scenarios. Results from this test illustrate that a multiple-USRP setup is a useful tool for testing robust interference mitigation techniques.}

Coupled with smartphones, the blue dot in the palm of our hands has forever changed the way we interact with the world. Looking forward, cyber-physical systems such as self-driving cars and aerial mobility are pushing the limits of what localization technologies including GNSS can provide. This autonomous revolution requires a solution that supports safety-critical operation, centimeter positioning, and cyber-security for millions of users. To meet these demands, we propose a navigation service from Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites which deliver precision in-part through faster motion, higher power signals for added robustness to interference, constellation autonomous integrity monitoring for integrity, and encryption / authentication for resistance to spoofing attacks. This paradigm is enabled by the `New Space' movement, where highly capable satellites and components are now built on assembly lines and launch costs have decreased by more than tenfold. Such a ubiquitous positioning service enables a consistent and secure standard where trustworthy information can be validated and shared, extending the electronic horizon from sensor line of sight to an entire city. This enables the situational awareness needed for true safe operation to support autonomy at scale.},
